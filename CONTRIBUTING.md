# Contributing to A11y VR Boxing Game

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the A11y VR Boxing Game as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add a test plan document, and specify the steps needed to test that feature.
3. Make sure your code has comments, and is readable
4. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any new features or changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one moderator

## Commit Style

We follow a consistent commit message format to maintain a clean and readable git history. Please follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(audio): add spatial audio for opponent position

- Implement 3D audio positioning
- Add distance-based volume adjustment
- Include directional cues for movement

Closes #123
```

## Creating Issues

When creating an issue, please:

1. Provide a clear and descriptive title
2. Describe the issue in detail
3. Include steps to reproduce if it's a bug
4. Add screenshots or videos if applicable
5. Label the issue appropriately

## Code Style

- Follow Unity's C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
